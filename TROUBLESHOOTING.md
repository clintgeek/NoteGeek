# Troubleshooting: jwt-decode Issue

## Issue Description
The application is experiencing an error where `jwt_decode` is not recognized as a function, causing the login process to fail. This issue was not present initially, suggesting that something changed in the way the module is being imported or used.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Check Import Syntax
- **Action**: Ensure the import statement for `jwt-decode` is correct.
- **Expected**: `import jwt_decode from 'jwt-decode';`
- **Result**: The import syntax was correct, but the issue persisted.

### 2. Clear Vite's Cache
- **Action**: Clear Vite's cache and rebuild the project.
- **Command**: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
- **Result**: The issue persisted after clearing the cache.

### 3. Reinstall jwt-decode
- **Action**: Reinstall the `jwt-decode` package to ensure it is correctly installed.
- **Command**: `npm install jwt-decode`
- **Result**: The issue persisted after reinstalling the package.

### 4. Check for Recent Changes
- **Action**: Review recent commits or changes to see if there were any modifications to the login flow or how `jwt-decode` is imported.
- **Result**: No significant changes were found that would affect the import of `jwt-decode`.

### 5. Inspect Vite Configuration
- **Action**: Check the `vite.config.js` file for any configurations that might affect module resolution.
- **Result**: No specific configurations were found that would affect the import of `jwt-decode`.

### 6. Use a Different Import Method
- **Action**: Try using a different import method, such as a dynamic import or CommonJS syntax.
- **Result**: The issue persisted with different import methods.

### 7. Dynamic Import
- **Action**: Use a dynamic import inside the `login`, `register`, and `hydrateUser` functions.
- **Result**: The issue persisted, and linter errors were introduced due to `jwt_decode` being used in multiple functions.

## Next Steps
- **Investigate User State**: Check the logic where the user state is set and ensure that it's being updated as expected after login.
- **Review Authentication Flow**: Ensure that the authentication flow correctly sets the user state and that the `hydrateUser` function is working as intended.
